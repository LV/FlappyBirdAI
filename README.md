This is my very first start at trying out any sort of machine learning or artificial intelligence. I am following Bluefever Software's tutorial which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbebDQ1Kiqdh1LNz6PavzptO). His repo can be found [here](https://github.com/bluefeversoft/flappy_learning_pygame/)
