# FlappyBirdAI
A neural network for Flappy Bird using reinforcement learning

This is my very first start at trying out any sort of machine learning or artificial intelligence. I am following Bluefever Software's tutorial which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbebDQ1Kiqdh1LNz6PavzptO). His repo can be found [here](https://github.com/bluefeversoft/flappy_learning_pygame/).


## How to install and run

1. Clone this repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/LV/FlappyBirdAI` 
2. Go into the project directory and install the required packages: `$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the program `$ python3 src/main.py`


## _master_ and _no-ai_ branches 

There are two branches of the repository, _master_ and _no-ai_. The _no-ai_ branch is version of the game you can play where as the _master_ branch will be where all the reinforcement learning will take place.
